# jpy
java "implementation" to python (whatever that means) <br>
its probably not objectively "better" but implements certain things from java into python that provides a bit more verboseness to the language. More importantly, it makes myself a happy camper, even if its very minuscule changes or edits.

## how to use the library
there is no pip library yet.
but go to the directory
type `pip install .`
import the library as the following
`from jpy import <method name>`
or
`from jpy import *` to import all
