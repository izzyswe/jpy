# jpy
java "implementation" to python (whatever that means) <br>
its probably not objectively "better" but implements certain things from java into python that provides a bit more verboseness to the language. More importantly, it makes myself a happy camper, even if its very minuscule changes or edits.

## how to use the library
there is no pip library yet. <br>

### However, go to the file directory <br>
type `pip install .`  to install locally into your pip library <br>
import the library as the following <br>
`from jpy import <method name>` <br>
or <br>
`from jpy import *` to import all
